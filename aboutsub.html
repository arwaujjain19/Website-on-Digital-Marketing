             Digital Dojo OU is a digital marketing training & consulting company based in Tallinn (Estonia) with offshore offices in Mumbai (India) and Goa (India). Digital Dojo is today associated with some of the most respected names in the field of digital marketing. We have established ourselves as the digital marketing training partners of choice for many new-age businesses. We specialize in working with Entrepreneurs, Business Owners and Start-Up Founders. <br>
             Digital Dojo started as a digital marketing training firm. Our objective was to empower students & working professionals with various digital marketing skills. We worked relentlessly, with corporate and academic institutes, imparting digital marketing education and empowering people with new age digital marketing skills. As of 1st July 2019, Digital Dojo has conducted 200+ workshops and 500+ days of training, with more than 12000 professionals and students trained.
             The journey as a digital training firm has been quite enjoyable - with its share of challenges and victories. In 2016, we established our Indian office in Mumbai, conducting training programs in digital marketing & digital technologies. We were named among "India's 10 Most Promising Digital Training Institutes of 2017" in a survey conducted by Higher Education Review in August 2017. <br>
             In August 2018, we launched DDLP. DDLP is our online learning platform to upskill people and brands with digital marketing skills required to succeed in the digital economy. Through DDLP, we provide a complete learning ecosystem - courses, live sessions, assignments, proctored online exams, project evaluation, block-chained certificates & job listings - to help achieve learning objectives.  Our assurance focused approach, combined with knowledge gained from years of imparting digital marketing education, has enabled us to deliver measurable learning results to our customers. Our goal today, is to educate and endow - people and organizations - with digital skills, strategies and new business models, in the age of digital disruption. <br> 
             Our practical experience & knowledge of delivering outcome-based digital marketing projects, allows us to engage with our customers as digital marketing thought leaders. We believe that "digital marketing needs" have to be integrated across marketing, technology and learning initiatives. Companies cannot work on "digital marketing needs" through an isolated approach.

Digital Dojo offers  training and consulting in Digital Marketing to all our customers across Europe, US, Australia & Asia.<br>
