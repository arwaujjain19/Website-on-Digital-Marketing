		      <b>Importance of Digital Marketing Analytics</b><br>
			   
			   Over the past few years, the significance of digital marketing has quantifiably extended in pretty much every industry. With the right digital marketing technique, your eCommerce business can fundamentally broaden its range, work all the more effectively, and draw nearer to accomplishing its long haul money related targets.<br>

               While the advantages of digital marketing are promptly evident, knowing whether your group's particular methodology has been working represents a substantially more troublesome test. Rather than searching for a methodology that "appears" to satisfy, you will be much better off searching for quantitative proof that underpins what you've been doing.<br>

               Luckily, the universe of digital marketing analytics has had the capacity to stay aware of a quickly changing advertising condition. There will be a wide range of edges your eCommerce business can see what you've achieved; the one that bodes well for you will rely upon the particular idea of your business.<br>

              Benefits of digital marketing analytics<br>

              Just like the case with apparently every segment of your business, on the off chance that you are running any kind of digital marketing campaign (or are selling in the eCommerce space), conducting analytics will be vital. Without investigation, you are doing minimal more than basically speculating and trusting that things will go well.<br>

              Some of the benefits of having analytics are: <br>

              - Determining which channels have the lowest customer acquisition cost and which channels can reach the widest audience.<br>
              - Identifying the benefits and costs of each of your campaigns.<br>
              - Knowing your company's digital strengths and digital weaknesses.<br>
              - Finding opportunities to increase your day-to-day profit margins.<br>
              - Recognizing which customers are repeat customers, willing to spend the most, and are willing to refer your business to their friends.<br>
              – Indicating which campaigns will be worth expanding and which campaigns can ultimately be scrapped.<br>
              With a proven body of data by your side, making your next decision will be significantly easier. Using an opportunity cost framework-which can be supported through the use of hard analytic data—you can decide where your next marginal dollar can be most effectively spent.<br>

              With multiple ratios, reports, and analytic tools to choose from, there will be many different ways for your business to tangibly measure your business overall performance online. While it will likely be worth your time to at least take a look at many different eCommerce indicators, over time, there will likely be a few that your business favors over others.<br>
              - Traffic by Channels will help you identify where the visitors to your eCommerce website are actually coming from. This will make it much easier to determine if social media, organic searches (Google, etc.), or direct visitors have had the largest impact.<br>
              - Clicks per Visit/Time Spent on Site will help you see if your website is actually capable of connecting with your target audience. The more time that somebody spends on your website, the more likely they will convert into a purchase.<br>
              - Revenue per Visitor helps you determine how efficient your website actually is. Efforts that increase your revenue per visitor will be even more valuable than efforts to increase your total number of visitors.<br>
              - Cost per Conversion will help you determine your overall profit margins—companies with costs that are greater than revenues will almost always need to make a change.<br>
              - Lead to Close Ratio indicates how many "almost buyers" become actual buyers. This may have a major impact on the way you target each of your potential leads.<br>
              - Return on Investment is a broad metric that can help you evaluate the overall value of your marketing efforts. When all else is equal, anything that increases your return on investment will be worth pursuing.<br>
