		 <b>Digital Marketing: to reach millennials</b><br>

         Millennials (Gen Y) play a huge role in digital marketing - they're the generation that is tech savvy, 'in-touch' and have grown up in a social media world, so they are a key target market for many a digital marketing campaign. If they are your target market, or a segment of your market, engaging with millennials is super important for brand awareness, customer acquisition and retention, so shape your campaign around their characteristics and demographics, engagement tendencies, digital trends and purchase decisions.<br>

        Gen Y i.e. Millennials are very smart when It comes to influence them. So, let's see how we can try to engage millennials in our digital marketing strategy.<br>
         
         1. Use Social Media Platforms:<br>
         This way has to be the first and most important way to engage with Gen y people. Millennials aren't referred to as the 'digital generation' for nothing. They are without a doubt the most tech savvy generation on the planet right now and are constantly on top of new trends in the digital world, especially when it comes to social media platforms. A great way to engage Gen Y in your digital marketing strategy is to embrace social media platforms like Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram - along with all of their multi-media features such as Snapchat stories, Facebook LIVE and Instagram stories. By using any of the social media platforms you are guaranteed to reach millennials and when you use all of the features especially video feature this will give boost to your engagement strategy. something that is fun to watch and doesn't come across as an ad is the best kind of content to grab their attention, so allocate budget, resources and creative to social media.<br>

         2. Create brand culture or community:<br>
         Consumers are much more likely to engage with a brand that has an established culture and community, because it's something they can be a part of, contribute to or aspire to be. Millennials crave culture and community, so brands who do it, see success with their young target market. So, how do you build culture and community? Create a space online that Gen Y consumers can relate to and engage with. It could be something small like a community hashtag, or on a large scale, like an event where top customers are invited to preview a new product, or get access to it before the general public. When you create culture and community that goes beyond your product or service, you're building something that people will want to be a part of, and as a result, you're engaging with your target market and building a long-term relationship with them.<br>

         3. Traditional marketing is not the first choice for Gen Y:<br>
         Consider that eight out of 10 millennials regard their smartphone an essential life tool - this generation is forcing most industries into a fully digital direction, with mobile-friendly content at the core. With the average 18-34-year-olds spending 25 hours online per week, their world is digital - as various studies have shown, they have no need for traditional advertising. Moreover, millennials crave authenticity, and the classic forms of advertising from the days of TV commercials and print ads - tend to be seen as pushy and disingenuous.<br>

         4. Be subtle & genuine:<br>
         On other note, Millennials are the most exposed to digital world and because of this they are used to see advertising while using mobile phones or any other product. o if content is too "salesy" they will completely ignore it. Marketing to Millennials needs to be subtle and genuine and it needs to add value to their life in some way. If you’re forcing something at them with a sales message, they will tune out. However, if you're subtle yet strategic, you can get your product or brand in front of their mind to influence their purchase decisions before they even realize it. It’s all about the long-term gain, rather than the short-term win.<br>

         5. Convenient options & timing:<br>
         Convenience is key for Millennials in the digital space, so things like free shipping, 30-day returns and good quality, consistent customer service should be a high priority. It's also important to ensure the timing of your content is planned strategically, to best capture the market and drive leads. Post on socials when Millennials are most on the phones, usually during the morning and at night, with spikes in the middle of the day around lunch time. Of course, this may be different for each brand and industry, but as a general rule, this is when Millennials are on their phones, laptops and tablets browsing.
         <br>
         Those who have been most successful in answering this million-, billion- or even trillion-dollar question are leaving traditional marketing behind and investing in design, and on using social media and technology to speak directly and specifically to millennials.
