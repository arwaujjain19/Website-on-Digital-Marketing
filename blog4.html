		   <b>Why Digital Dojo is the right choice for you!</b><br>
		   This is the last blog of our "Why choose Digital Dojo?" series. If you have not read the previous blogs then read it now!<br>

           Digital Dojo started the journey in 2016 and now it is providing safe and sound digital education over the internet. Digital Dojo OU is an education first, digital marketing training company based in Tallinn (Estonia) with offshore offices in Mumbai (India) and Goa (India). Digital Dojo is today associated with some of the most respected names in the field of digital marketing. We are the digital marketing training partners to some big industry brands. We have established ourselves as the digital marketing training partners of choice to many leading businesses.<br>

           But what makes us different in this digital learning world?<br>
           As of 1st July, 2019, Digital Dojo has conducted more than 200 workshops and 500+ days of training. Digital Dojo has done a lot of research before providing the online education on the internet. The main aim of Digital Dojo is to spread digital awareness and explain why digital education is better option for the world. Digital Dojo has created an amazing online learning ecosystem for people who want the best learning experience on the internet.<br>

           There are so many misconceptions about E-Learning.

           1.Digital Dojo Vs. Google Certification:<br>
           As a digital marketer, having Google certification gives you the credibility which is great! But in our opinion, anyone can clear the google tests. There is no supervision for the test on Google. Just copy the question and paste it in other browser and choose the correct answer. It is as simple as that to clear Google certifications. But we also know and appreciate that there are few people who give this test genuinely. In the end, there is no difference if you cleared the test genuinely or by cheating. Also, you will not get practical knowledge from it. But Digital Dojo is all about practical knowledge. The exams conducted by Digital Dojo are proctored. Apart from the exam, the quiz score, assignments, project are all taken into consideration while evaluating the complete score as a digital marketer. So, what would you choose?

           2.Digital Dojo Vs. Online Learning Platforms:<br>
           There are too many myths or misconception about Online Learning. And most importantly people don't like to choose Online learning because they don't trust it enough. Of course, they have some valid reasons too. There are few online learning platforms who sell products in the name of course and nobody wants to get fooled by such courses. Sometimes you can't trust the instructor or what he is teaching because there is no validation of faculties on such platforms. Digital Dojo is a perfect solution for such problems. Digital Dojo's course content is very unique with rich multimedia videos. Content is created by doing a lot of research and the tools that are mentioned in the course are available for everyone. In short, Digital Dojo's main focus is on giving perfect knowledge in the form of rich multimedia videos to improve the user experience and as well as facilitate trust. The chief instructor, Mr. Sachin Sadare (Founder and Director of Digital Dojo) will always guide you through the right path of digital marketing even after the course completion.

           3.Digital Dojo Vs. Popular Digital Marketing Training Institutes:<br>
           Yes! There are so many popular Digital Marketing Training Institutes available online and offline. People often tend to choose the popular institutes because they think it is the best option. Even if they are popular, they may not be the correct option for you. These popular institutes are mostly "Instructor Driven". They have become popular in digital marketing education over the last few years, even maybe a decade. However, with that - their training methods and also their instructors have changed. They no longer have the best faculty to teach digital marketing. And such institutes mostly give you the "Completion Certificate" when you finish the course. There is no proper evaluation. But Digital Dojo you will get "Certificate of Merit" only on completing all the evaluation criteria. This certificate is block chained so that all evaluation details can be seen by anyone who wants to hire you. Thus, Digital Dojo promises you "Digital Assurance".<br>
